It was truly a memorable experience! Firstly, I traveled to ${placeInput} with my family by ${vehicleInput}, which made me feel quite ${emotionInput}. We explored the beautiful surroundings with vibrant ${colourInput} scenery. During our holiday, I met a fascinating person named Mr./Ms. ${nameInput}, who works as a ${occupationInput}. They showed me around the local area and taught me about their profession. I was amazed by their knowledge and dedication. One day, we visited a unique store with a ${shapeInput}-shaped entrance. Inside, there were so many interesting ${objectInput} I couldn't resist picking up a few souvenirs to remember the trip. Overall, my summer holiday was filled with fun, adventure, and new experiences. I can't wait to go back to ${placeInput} again and create more cherished memories. Wishing you a fantastic summer filled with happiness and adventure!`;

Then, ${nameInput} saw me and took a(n) ${objectInput} from his pocket. The ${objectInput} was ${colourInput}, and ${nameInput} told me they were going to use it to fix the ${vehicleInput}. I asked ${nameInput} why they were talking to the ${vehicleInput} instead of fixing it and they told me they were waiting for ${numberInput} ${occupationInput}s. After they finished their words, I suddenly transformed into a(n) ${occupationInput} but neither ${nameInput} nor ${vehicleInput} were there. I was in front of a ${shapeInput} house and started walking away from the house to find ${nameInput}. While walking I heard my alarm ringing, and I woke up. What a strange dream it was!`;

It was a beautiful day, with the sun shining and a gentle breeze in the air. We packed our favorite foods and set off in our trusty ${vehicleInput}, excited for a day of relaxation and fun. Upon arriving at ${placeInput}, we found the perfect spot under a large ${colorInput} umbrella. As we unpacked our picnic basket, I noticed a friendly face nearby. It was ${nameInput}, carrying a colorful kite and looking quite ${emotionInput}. We invited ${nameInput} to join us, and together we enjoyed a delicious feast of sandwiches, fruits, and homemade treats. ${nameInput} shared stories of their adventures and hobbies, adding a joyful atmosphere to our gathering. After our meal, we decided to fly the ${shapeInput}-shaped kite with ${nameInput}. The sky was clear, and the kite soared gracefully, painting a beautiful picture against the blue backdrop. As the day was about to end, we thanked ${nameInput} for their company and said goodbye. We packed our belongings, including the kite and our cherished ${objectInput} souvenirs, and headed home, grateful for such a lovely day. I hope this letter brings a smile to your face, imagining the warmth and happiness of our picnic adventure. Wishing you many more joyful moments and happy picnics in the days ahead.

Firstly, we watched a clown making ${objectInput}-shaped balloons. He made ${numberInput} balloons and gave me one bright ${colourInput} ${objectInput}-shaped balloon. However, it blew off 15 minutes later. It made me sad, but I forgot about it at costume cabin. I wore a(n) ${occupationInput} costume and ${nameInput} wore a hawk costume, we looked so funny together and we took many photos. Later, we tried a 4d ${vehicleInput} simulator, I had a great laugh when {numberInput} insisted on visiting ${placeInput} with their virtual ${vehicleInput} but could not. After that we rode on ferris wheel and ate ice cream. I was feeling quite ${emotionInput} as the closing time was approaching. I hope to visit there with you some other day, maybe we can ride the roller coaster too. Have you ever ridden a roller coaster? I will be looking forward to hearing from you. A friend :)`
